# 👨🏽‍💻 Grunty

Self-hosted desktop app to have AI control your computer, powered by the new Claude [computer use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) capability. Allow Claude to take over your laptop and do your tasks for you (or at least attempt to, lol). Written in Python, using PyQt.

## Demo
Here, I asked it to use [vim](https://vim.rtorr.com/) to create a game in Python, run it, and play it.

Video was sped up 8x btw. [Computer use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) is pretty slow as of today.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

1. **This is experimental software** - It gives an AI control of your mouse and keyboard. Things can and will go wrong.

2. **Tread Lightly** - If it wipes your computer, sends weird emails, or orders 100 pizzas... that's on you. 

Anthropic can see your screen through screenshots during actions. Hide sensitive information or private stuff.

## 🎯 Features
- Literally ask AI to do ANYTHING on your computer that you do with a mouse and keyboard. Browse the web, write code, blah blah.

# 💻 Platforms
- Anything you can run Python on: MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc.

## 🛠️ Setup

Get an Anthropic API key [here]([https://console.anthropic.com/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard)).

```bash
# Python 3.10+ recommended
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add API key to .env
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run
python run.py
```

## 🔑 Productivity Keybindings
- `Ctrl + Enter`: Execute the current instruction
- `Ctrl + C`: Stop the current agent action
- `Ctrl + W`: Minimize to system tray
- `Ctrl + Q`: Quit application

## 💡 Tips
- Claude really loves Firefox. You might want to install it for better UI detection and accurate mouse clicks.
- Be specific and explicit, help it out a bit
- Always monitor the agent's actions

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Sometimes, it doesn't take a screenshot to validate that the input is selected, and types stuff in the wrong place.. Press CMD+C to end the action when this happens, and quit and restart the agent. I'm working on a fix.
